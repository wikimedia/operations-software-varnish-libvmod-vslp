DESCRIPTION
===========

VSLP Director - Varnish StateLess Persistence Director

The purpose of this director is to provide stateless persistence (or
persistency if you prefer) for backend requests based upon this simple
concept:

* Generate a load balancing key, which will be used to select the backend
  The key values should be as uniformly distributed as possible.
  For all requests which need to hit the same backend server, the same
  key must be generated.
  For strings, a hash function can be used to generate the key.

* Select the preferred backend server using an implementation of consistent
  hashing (cf. Karger et al, references below), which ensures that the same
  hosts are always chosen for every key (for instance hash of incoming URL)
  in the same order (i.e. if the preferred host is down, then alternative
  hosts are always chosen in a fixed order).

* Initialize a circular data structure consisting of the hash values of
  "hostname%d" for each host and for a running number from 1 to n (n is
  the number of "replicas").

* For the load balancing key, find the smallest hash value in the circle
  that is larger than the key (searching clockwise and wrapping around
  as necessary).

* If the host thus selected is down, choose alternative hosts by
  continuing to search clockwise in the circle.

On consistent hashing see:

* http://www8.org/w8-papers/2a-webserver/caching/paper2.html
* http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/ketama/
* svn://svn.audioscrobbler.net/misc/ketama
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing

This technique allowes to implement persistence without keeping any state,
and, in particular, without the need to synchronize state between nodes of a
cluster of Varnish servers.

Still, all members of a cluster will, if otherwise configured equally,
implement the same persistence, in other words, requests sharing a common
persistence criterium will be balanced onto the same backend server no matter
which Varnish server handles the request.

The drawbacks are:

* the distribution of requests depends on the number of requests per key and
  the uniformity of the distribution of key values. In short, this technique
  will generally lead to less good load balancing compared to stateful
  techniques.

* When a backend server becomes unavailable, every persistence technique has
  to reselect a new backend server, but this technique will also switch back
  to the preferred server once it becomes healthy again, so the persistence
  is generally less stable compared to stateful techniques (which would
  continue to use a selected server for as long as possible (or dictated by a
  TTL)).

The name VSLP was chosen to accompany VTLA as another VETR (Varnish
Exception To the Rule) ;-) http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/VTLA



FUNCTIONS
=========

VSLP needs to be configured before it can hand out backends. The functions not
returning a backend, should only be called in vcl_init, as we can safely skip
locking for most parts of the code, if we do not modify the hash ring after
initialization.

VOID .add_backend(BACKEND)
--------------------------
Adds a backend to the Director, must be called in before init_hashcircle().

VOID .set_rampup_ratio(REAL)
----------------------------

Sets the raito of requests (0.0 to 1.0) that goes to the next alternate backend
to warm it up if the preferd backend is healthy. If the prefered backend just
recoverd from beeing unhealthy, the ratio will be used to warm the prefered
backend. Defaults to 0.1 (10%).

VOID .set_rampup_time(DURATION)
-------------------------------

Sets the duration that will be used to determine if a backend will be counted
as warmed after recovering from an unhealthy state. During the warm-up period,
only the rampup-ratio of requests will go to the recoverd backend. Defaults
to 60 seconds.

VOID .set_hash(ENUM { CRC32, SHA256, RS })
------------------------------------------

Sets the default hash algorithm used to choose a backend by backend(). Defaults
to CRC32.

VOID .init_hashcircle(INT)
--------------------------

Initializes the hash ring. This function must be called after all backends are
added. The argument is the numbers of replicas the hash ring contains for each
backend.

INT .hash_string(STRING, ENUM { CRC32, SHA256, RS })
----------------------------------------------------

Returns the hash of its first argument using the hash
algorithm defined.

BACKEND .backend()
------------------

Returns a backend based on the default hash of the request URL.

BACKEND .backend_n(INT, BOOL, BOOL, INT)
----------------------------

Returns the n-th backend (first parameter) with respect of altsrv_p (second
parameter) and respect of its healthy state (third parameter) for the given
hash (last parameter).

BACKEND .backend_by_int(INT)
----------------------------

Returns a backend based on the value of its parameter. The value should be
evenly distributet between 0 and MAX_INT to get a good distribution of requests.

BACKEND .backend_by_string(STRING)
----------------------------------

Returns a backend based on the default hash of its argument.
DEPRECATED: use .backend_by_int(hash_string()) instead

BACKEND .backend_by_string_hash(STRING, ENUM { CRC32, SHA256, RS })
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns a backend based on the hash of its first argument using the hash
algorithm defined.
DEPRECATED: use .backend_by_int(hash_string()) instead


LIMITATIONS
===========

* The number of backends per director is limited to 64.
* Adding backends after initializing the hash ring is possible, but invalid, as
  such backends will not be choosen. Calling init_hashcircle() twice on the same
  VSLP instance is invalid.


INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Usage::

 ./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod
* make install - installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``


MISSING
=======
* Documentation of interactions with restarts/retries
